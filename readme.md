IMDB Search Suggest for Alfred
=====================================

[Download](https://github.com/redwallhp/Alfred_IMDB_Suggest/blob/master/IMDB_Suggest.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Version 1.0.0

This [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) extension runs on the "imdb" keyword. It queries the Internet Movie Database as you type and returns results that let you jump directly to the corresponding pages.

If you already have an active Alfred web search for the "imdb" keyword, uncheck the Enabled box to prevent potential conflicts. Or you can change the keyword this workflow uses if you double-click the Script Filter icon in the workflow and replace it with something else.
